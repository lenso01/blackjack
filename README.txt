This is my fist app. It was very challenging project for me. It took about 5 days to finish this app. I didn't look at someone elses codes to get idea. I wanted to be as creative as possible without looking at other codes.
I learned a lot off new things. One of the biggest issue how to handle Ace. Also Converting Strings to value and calculating required a lot of work around. 
I believe a lot of things could be done shorter way in codes. I’m sure i will find these shortcuts  to spend less time on coding and having elegent elegant code. It was very exciting for me and I’m very happy.
This app is my “Hello World”
