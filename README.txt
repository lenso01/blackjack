This is my first app. It was a very challenging project for me. It took about 5 days to finish this up. I didn't look at someone else codes to get an idea. I wanted to be as creative as possible without looking at other codes.
I learned a lot of new things. One of the biggest issue how to handle Ace. Also Converting Strings to value and calculating them required a lot of work around. 
I believe a lot of things could be done shorter way in my codes. I’m sure I will find these shortcuts to spend less time on coding and having an elegant code. It was very exciting for me and I’m very happy.

This app is my “Hello World”
